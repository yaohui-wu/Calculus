\subsection{Implicit Differentiation}
A function \(y=f(x)\) is defined by expressing one variable explicitly in
terms of another variable.
Some functions are defined implicitly by a relation between \(x\) and \(y\).
The equation of the unit circle \(x^2+y^2=1\) is an implicit function.
In some cases it is possible to solve an implicit function to get an explicit function.
We can use the method of implicit differentiation to find the derivative of \(y\)
in an implicit function.
\begin{problem}
    Find \(dy/dx\) of \(x^2+y^2=1\)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    We differentiate on both sides of the equation then we have
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{d}{dx}(x^2+y^2)&=\frac{d}{dx}(1) \\
        \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)+\frac{d}{dx}(y^2)&=0
    \end{align*}
    Since \(y=f(x)\), we use the chain rule then we have
    \begin{align*}
        2x+\frac{d}{dy}(y^2)\frac{dy}{dx}=0 \\
        2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0
    \end{align*}
    We solve for \(dy/dx\) then we have
    \[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-x}{y}\qedhere\]
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
    Find \(dy/dx\) of the folium of Descartes \(x^3+y^3=6xy\).
\end{problem}
