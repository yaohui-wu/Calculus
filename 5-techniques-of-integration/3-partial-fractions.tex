\subsection{Partial Fractions}
\subsubsection{Partial Fractions}
Consider a rational function \(\displaystyle{f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}}\) where
\(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials.
If \(f\) is improper, that is, \(\deg(P)\geq\deg(Q)\), then we simplify to get
\(\displaystyle{f(x)=S(x)+\frac{R(x)}{Q(x)}}\) where \(S\) and \(R\) are
polynomials.
Then we can factor \(Q\) to be irreducible and express \(\dfrac{R(x)}{Q(x)}\)
as the a sum of partial fractions of the form
\[\frac{A}{(ax+b)^i}\quad\text{or}\quad\frac{Ax+B}{(ax^2+bx+c)^j}\]
There are four possible cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(Q\) is a product of distinct linear factors.
    Then
    \[Q(x)=(a_1 x+b_1)(a_2 x+b_2)\cdots(a_k x+b_k)\]
    and therefore
    \[\frac{R(x)}{Q(x)}=\frac{A_1}{a_1 x+b_1}+\frac{A_2}{a_2 x+b_2}+\cdots+
    \frac{A_k}{a_k x+b_k}\]
    \item \(Q\) is a product of linear factors where some are repeated.
    Suppose that the first linear factor is repeated \(r\) times, then we have
    \[\frac{A_1}{a_1 x+b_1}+\frac{A_2}{(a_1 x+b_1)^2}+\cdots+
    \frac{A_r}{(a_1 x+b_1)^r}\]
    for the first repeated linear factor and similarly for other repeated
    linear factors.
    \item \(Q\) has irreducible quadratic factors without repeated
    factors.
    Then for every quadratic factor we have
    \[\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}\]
    \item \(Q\) has a repeated irreducible quadratic factor.
    Suppose that the first quadratic factor is repeated \(r\) times,
    then we have
    \[\frac{A_1 x+B_1}{ax^2+bx+c}+\frac{A_2 x+B_2}{(ax^2+bx+c)^2}+\cdots
    +\frac{A_r x+B_r}{(ax^2+bx+c)^r}\]
    for the first repeated quadratic factor and similarly for the others.
\end{enumerate}
