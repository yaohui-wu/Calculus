\subsection{Sequences}
An infinite \textbf{sequence} \(\{a_n\}\) is a list of numbers defined by
\[a_1,a_2,a_3\dots,a_n,a_{n+1},\dots\]
where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)th term of the sequence.
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) has the limit \(L\)
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\]
    if we can make the terms \(a_n\) as close to \(L\) as we like by taking
    \(n\) sufficiently large.
    If \(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\) exists, then the sequence is convergent,
    otherwise it is divergent.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) has the limit \(L\)
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\]
    if for every \(\epsilon>0\) there eixsts an integer \(N\) such that
    \[n>N\implies |a_n-L|<\epsilon\qedhere\]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    If \(\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L\) and \(f(n)=a_n\) when \(n\) is an integer,
    then \(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{definition}
    \(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\infty\) if for every positive number \(M\) there
    is a positive integer \(N\) such that
    \[n>N\implies a_n>M\qedhere\]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Continuity and Convergence Theorem]
    If \(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\) and the function \(f\) is continuous at
    \(L\), then
    \[\lim_{n\to\infty}f(a_n)=f(L)\qedhere\]
\end{theorem}
The sequence \(\{r^n\}\) is convergent if \(-1<r\leq 1\) and divergent for all
other values of \(r\).
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is increasing if \(a_n<a_{n+1}\) for all
    \(n\geq 1\), that is, \(a_1<a_2<a_3<\cdots<a_n<a_{n+1}<\cdots\).
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is decreasing if \(a_n>a_{n+1}\) for all
    \(n\geq 1\), that is, \(a_1>a_2>a_3>\cdots>a_n>a_{n+1}>\cdots\).
    A sequence is monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is bounded above if there exists a number \(M\)
    such that \(a_n\leq M\) for all \(n\leq 1\).
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is bounded below if there exists a number \(m\)
    such that \(m\leq a_n\) for all \(n\leq 1\).
    If a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is bounded above and below, then \(\{a_n\}\) is
    a bounded sequence.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Monotonic Sequence Theorem]
    Every bounded, monotonic sequence is convergent.
\end{theorem}
