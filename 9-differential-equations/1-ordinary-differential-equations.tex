\subsection{Ordinary Differential Equations}
A \textbf{differential equation} is an equation that relates some unknown
functions and their derivatives.
An \textbf{ordinary differential equation} (ODE) is a differential equation
that relates functions of a single variable and their ordinary derivatives.
An example of an odinary differential equation is \[\frac{dy}{dx}=y\]
The \textbf{order} of a differential equation is the highest order of the
derivative the equation.
Newton's second law of motion \[F=ma\] is a differential equation since it can
written as \[F=m\frac{dv}{dt}\] which is a first order differential equation,
or \[F=m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\] which is a second order differential equation.
A function \(f\) is a \textbf{solution} of the differential equation if the
function \(f\) and its derivatives make the equation true for all values of
\(x\) in some interval.
We want to find the general solution when we solve a differential equation.
