\subsection{Separable Equations}
\subsubsection{Saparation of Variables}
A \textbf{separable equation} is a first order differential equation that can
be written in the form \[\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)g(y)\]
We can separate the variables if \(g(y)\neq0\), let \(h(y)=1/g(y)\) then we
have \[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{f(x)}{h(y)}\]
We write the equation in the differential form \[h(y)\,dy=f(x)\,dx\] so that
there is a function of \(y\) on one side of the equation and a function of
\(x\) on the other side.
Then we integrate both sides of the equation with respect to the variable of
the function.
\[\int h(y)\,dy=\int f(x)\,dx\]
Now we have an implicit solution and in some cases we can solve for an
explicit solution then we have
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d}{dx}\int h(y)\,dy&=\frac{d}{dx}\int f(x)\,dx\\
    \frac{d}{dy}\int h(y)\,dy\frac{dy}{dx}&=f(x)\\h(y)\frac{dy}{dx}&=f(x)
\end{align*}
Therefore, we solved the differential equation by
\textbf{separation of variables}.
\begin{problem}
    Solve the differential equation \[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x^2}{y^2}\] with the
    initial condition \(y(0)=2\).
\end{problem}
