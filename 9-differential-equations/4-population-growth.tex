\subsection{Population Growth}
Let \(y=y(t)\) such that
\[\frac{dy}{dt}=ky\]
where \(k\) is a constant, then the differential equation is the law of
natural growth if \(k>0\) or the law of natural decay if \(k<0\).
Since the differential equation is separable, then
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dy}{dt} &= ky \\
    \int\frac{dy}{y} &= \int k\,dt \\
    \ln|y| &= kt+C \\
    |y| &= e^{kt+C}=e^Ce^{kt} \\
    y &= \pm e^Ce^{kt}=Ae^{kt}
\end{align*}
is the general solution of the differential equation so
\[\frac{dy}{dt}=kAe^{kt}=ky\]
and \(y(0)=Ae^0=A\) is the initial value.

\subsubsection{Logistic Growth}
If \(M\) is the carrying capacity, then the logistic differential equation is
\[\frac{dy}{dt}=ky(M-y)\]
